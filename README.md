# ChloeMyersFinalProject
Final project for UCR quantitative methods seminar on R

This project is investigating lipids and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). 

datLipids=original file that I cannot share, the file contains the following  variables that are simulated:

aid: participant identifier

Project:	participants either come from CAP where they are adopted or biological siblings or LTS where they are fraternal or identical twins

BDNFngmL:	measure of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) in serum

bdnf_batch:	identifies which batch their specific serum result was analyzed with, 3 batches total have been analyzed, so blood is drawn and these samples are kept and analyzed in batches, we have 3 but will eventually have 4

TOT_CHOL:	total cholesterol

HDL_CHOL:	HDL cholesterol

LDL_CHOL:	LDL cholesterol

Non-HDLCHOL:	cholesterol minus HDL

TRIG:	triglycerides

chol_batch:	what batch the lipids were analyzed with


datSiblings=original file that I cannot share, the file contains the following variables that are simulated:

pfamid: identifies what family unit a subject comes from

sibtotal:  how many siblings are in that family (that we have data for)

project: participants either come from CAP where they are adopted or biological siblings or LTS where they are fraternal or identical twins

aid: participant identifier

BDNFngmL: measure of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) in serum

sex: 1 is male, 2 is female

famtype: where the individual is from an adopted, control, fraternal, or identical family, 1=adoptive, 2=control, 3=dz(fraternal twins), 4=mz (identical  twins)

fast_hours: how many hours an individual fasted before having their blood drawn

cats_age: participants age

white: identifies if participant is white
